# Operating Systems - Linux

These are my labworks on the itmo operating systems course. 

## Setup 

I devided to use [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with a Debian 12.10.0 image I found [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/12.10.0/).

A good idea is to use ssh, so you can easily modify and edit your files from your terminal. Unfortunately I have some issues with apple silicon, so I can't persist my folder.
